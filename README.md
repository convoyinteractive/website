## Contribution Guide
Doing one thing at a time â€“ keep your PRs small, so they are easier to review and we can keep our release cycles short.

### Which Branch?
All **bug fixes** should be sent to the `production` branch. Bug fixes should **never** be sent to the `master` branch unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.

**New features** should always be sent to the `master` branch which contains the upcoming release.

### External Contributors
The project is maintained by the convoyinteractive organization. In general, we do accept contributions from members only. Nevertheless, if you have found a bug somewhere, feel free to send in a PR.
